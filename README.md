# Angular Interview Assignment

Purely angular application that will be used as a measurement of a candidate's familiarity with Angular.

## The Application Scenario

We would like a simple application to order a pizza.

* The default page would allow the user to select between Pick Up or Delivery
* Once selected, the app should load the 5 types of pizza we offer (Picture not required)
  * Chonky Chicken 10$
  * Beef Barbeque 12$
  * Hawking Hawaiian 10$
  * Margeret's Margherita 8$
  * Vegan Villa Vista 8$
* Selecting a pizza should give the user a few options:
  * Select the size (Small, Medium, Large)
  * Select if they would like extra cheese (Yes or No)
  * Select the quantity
* The user is allowed to select multiple pizzas
* The user is also allowed to remove pizzas
* Once the order is complete they can proceed to checkout
* The checkout should display a summary of their order including the pizza's sizes, cheese, quantity and finally the total price.
* Upon confirmation of the order, send the user to a thank you page then redirect them to back to the starting page
* If the user navigates to unknown pages (Such as writing on the URL), redirect them to a generic "Page not found"

## Points

Some things we would be looking out for in the app are:

* Project/code structure and uniformity
* Dynamically fetching and displaying content
* Clearly defined models and it's usage
* Test cases for the methods written
* Usage of module, service and components would be nice
* Styling would be a great plus but concentrate on getting a functioning app first
